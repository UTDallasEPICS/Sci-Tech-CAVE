GitHub collab. rules
In no particular order:

1) Keep everything clear for others. (i.e. commented and organized)
2) Do not leave assets in the root directory.
3) Do not push broken or incomplete changes to fix later to the main branch.
4) Fetch often. This will reduce conflicts you have to solve when merging.
